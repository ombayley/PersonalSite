# 📘 Web Development Basics

> A Simple website to host my projects and CV

---

## 🧩 Overview

 
Web development remains one of the most in-demand areas of programming, built upon the foundation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Modern applications, however, increasingly rely on powerful frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular, typically used with TypeScript for type safety and scalability.
This project explores both paradigms by developing two functionally equivalent websites:
1.	A “classic” implementation using raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2.	A modern implementation using TypeScript and React.

## 🎯 Objectives / Learning Goals

- 🔹 [Goal 1] — e.g., Understand how web frameworks are structured and their philosophy.  
- 🔹 [Goal 2] — e.g., Understand the interface and charecter of Frontend-Backend Communication  
- 🔹 [Goal 3] — e.g., •	Learn to deploy and host web applications.
