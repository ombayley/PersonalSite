# 📘 Web Development Basics

> A Simple website to host my projects and resume

---

## 🧩 Overview
 

Web development is one of the largest areas of programming. Aklthough this field has traditionally been built around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Modern applications, however, increasingly rely on new frameworks (React, Vue, or Angular)05 used in conjunction with TypeScript for type safety and scalability.

This project is laregly aimed at understanding how web frameworks are structured and how they work. 
Although my intrests lie in backend development, I hopt that building web applications will give me a better understanding of the philosophy used in web design to either give insight into backend structure for interfacing with front-end interfaces/frameworks or give me new insights into new ways to better structure my own backend code in other languages.

Although this project is done to learn frontend wb-development, I also want to have a productive outcome from it so will be using it to host my own personal resume.
